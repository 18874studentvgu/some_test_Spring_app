# Demo Spring App: one forum
This is just a project that I do to familiarize myself with the framework.

## What it has:
+ Full CRUD rest API to create, read, uodate and delete posts.
+ Database integration (using postgres).
+ A nice folder structure  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## What it doesn't have:
+ any real world useability.
 
## TODO (probably never)
+ Add a basic html interface to the app.
+ Add some ways to reduce chance of Identity theft (something like how viChan/tinyboard did it).
+ add some password based post deletion.
